# Data Mining in Healthcare Project

## Project Overview

This project applies neural network algorithms to a healthcare dataset to uncover insights and predictive patterns that can support medical decision-making. Our goal is to improve patient outcomes by leveraging the predictive power of data mining techniques.

## Files in the Repository

- `Data_Mining_Project_NN.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the neural network code for the data analysis.
- `Healthcare_Dataset_Data_Mining.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, which includes anonymized patient data.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and how to navigate through the repository.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report of the project's findings and methodology.
